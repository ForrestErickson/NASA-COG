During a high temperature test on the mornign of Wednesday Sept. 20th, Rob collected the following data on the wattage and amperage settings to show that 
the wattage control works.

It shows some accuracy in our digital hardware, but basically was a successful test.

Sadly, we were having problems with the thermocouple at this time, so I did not know the temperature.

|  Software Watts Limit | Software Amps  | Reported Watts  | Reported Amps  |

| 12  | 10  | 13.75  |  4.63 |
