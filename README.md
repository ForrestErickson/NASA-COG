# Public Invention Oxygen Concentrator

## Introduction

Medical grade oxygen is an essential component of respiratory therapy. Typically this is provided by industrial scale cryogenic oxygen concentrators. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the existing need for medical oxygen in field hospital settings around the world. These settings create a variety of challenges that need to be overcome to deliver oxygen to communities around the world.

Human resources are be limited both medically and technically. Medical staff communicate in a variety of local languages and may have little experience. Staff to patient ratios are much higher than is acceptable in a fully equipped hospital. Technical support staff face challenges such as lack of training and basic maintenance equipment.

Field hospital settings may be urban or rural. Environments such as high temperatures, high humidity and fine dust particles create engineering challenges.

Infrastructure and logistics create additional challenges. This is raised the requirement to design a device that can be manufactured locally, along with sufficient documentation to present to local regulatory authorities. Medical device standards must be met and this project aims to meet regulatory requirements.

# Project Status

**22 October 2020**

The system is now mounted to the board! Some changes have been made during the build to simplify it - the sieves now use barb fittings to avoid having to drill and tap 3/8" BSPT which is costly and requires a drill press. The pneumatic circuit has been modified to shorten the overall height. The valves have been tested manually and the overall operation appears to be correct. Next steps are to finish the driver circuits and fill the sieves.

**19 October 2020**

First build is almost ready for testing! Parts of the system have been tested independently. Next is to complete assembly for a full pressure test. Then fill the sieves with zeolite and start tuning the control system.
